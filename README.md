  The safeVote System is a secure electronic voting system based on identity signature which is implemented in B / S mode by combining matrix homomorphic encryption, matrix homomorphic encryption, and identity- based signature. The system consists of five parts, including registration module, voting module, query module, checking module, notarization module, and statistical module.
	Be responsible for utilizing a matrix homomorphic encryption algorithm with an identity-based signature 
  algorithm to provide the security foundation for the system.
	Won honorable mention in the 2012 National College Students Innovative Entrepreneurial Program, as
  Well as being awarded a national patent and computer software registration certificate.
